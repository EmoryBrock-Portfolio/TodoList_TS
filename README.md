based on tutorial by Developer George [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58D1xdBrPw8]

Here are the changes that I've made from the base tutorial:

- added a remove button that removes the item from the list
- added a done/undo button that puts a line-through the item text and toggles the button text accordingly
- added Tailwind CSS to the app
